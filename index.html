        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Ryan McIntyre. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I attended Penn State Behrend, unfortunately
                did not graduate. I moved to Palm Coast, Florida, when I was 22. I have had numerous jobs, but mostly was in retail.
                I made my way into management at every place I worked.
